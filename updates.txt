# CPU Optimization Plan - Camera Management System
# This plan is divided into small, manageable updates to significantly reduce CPU usage.

1. Optimize Camera Decoding & Reduce CPU Load: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Replace `cv2.VideoCapture()` with FFmpeg optimized decoding:
      - RTSP/RTMP/IP cameras:
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(f'ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i {rtsp_url} -f rawvideo -pix_fmt bgr24 -')
      - USB cameras:
        cap = CamGear(source=usb_index, backend="FFMPEG").start()
- [ ] Enable hardware-accelerated decoding (if available):
      cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_HW_ACCELERATION, cv2.VideoAccelerationType.VAAPI)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~40%

2. Frame Processing Optimization: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Skip redundant frames (process only every 2nd frame):
      def should_process_frame():
          return time.time() % 2 == 0
- [ ] Reduce FPS dynamically when CPU > 80%:
      if psutil.cpu_percent() > 80:
          self.max_fps = max(10, self.max_fps - 5)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~50%

3. Efficient Memory Management: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Replace shared memory with mmap for faster frame access:
      import mmap
      mm = mmap.mmap(-1, width * height * 3, access=mmap.ACCESS_WRITE)
- [ ] Use RAM buffer (deque) for fast frame access:
      from collections import deque
      frame_buffer = deque(maxlen=50)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~25%

4. Optimize Recording & Encoding: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Switch from OpenCV’s `cv2.VideoWriter` to FFmpeg Multithreaded Encoding:
      ffmpeg -threads 8 -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast output.mp4
- [ ] Use H.265 instead of H.264 for video encoding:
      ffmpeg -threads 8 -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset fast output.mp4
- [ ] Stop inactive cameras after 5 minutes:
      if time.time() - last_activity[camera_id] > 300:
          stop_camera(camera_id)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~40%

5. Optimize Streaming for Lower CPU Usage: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Use MJPEG streaming instead of per-frame JPEG encoding:
      def generate():
          while True:
              frame = get_frame()
              yield (b'--frame\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n')
- [ ] Replace WebSockets with WebRTC for video streaming.
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~35%

6. Convert Processes to Threads: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Switch from multiprocessing to a thread pool:
      from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
      pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~15-30%

7. Implement Asynchronous Processing: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Use asyncio for non-blocking I/O instead of blocking `cap.read()`:
      async def read_camera():
          while True:
              frame = await loop.run_in_executor(None, cap.read)
              process_frame(frame)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~20%

8. Advanced Resource Management: [0% Complete]
- [ ] Dynamically lower camera resolution when CPU > 85%:
      if psutil.cpu_percent() > 85:
          change_camera_resolution(640, 480)
- [ ] Enable process priority management:
      renice -n 10 -p $(pgrep python)
- [ ] Expected CPU Reduction: ~20%

-----------------------------------
# Summary:
# Current CPU Usage: ~178% per core per camera
# Expected CPU Usage After Optimization: ~15-20% per camera
# Implement these updates one at a time to maximize performance and try to implement features with core to avoid errors.

# Tips for Implementation:
# 1. Implement Changes One at a Time
# - Instead, make one change at a time and measure its impact before moving to the next.
# - Keep a change log to document what was changed and the observed impact.
# 2. Start with the Biggest Wins First
# - FFmpeg decoding instead of OpenCV’s cv2.VideoCapture() (biggest win).
# - Frame skipping & adaptive FPS (huge CPU reduction).
# - MJPEG streaming instead of per-frame JPEG encoding (major efficiency boost).
# - H.265 encoding instead of H.264 (lower CPU usage during recording).
# - Thread pool instead of multiprocessing (reduces overhead).



# Next Steps:
# - Test optimizations individually and measure CPU usage after each.
# - Adjust values dynamically based on real-time performance.
# - Keep logs to track CPU performance before and after changes.
